                "intro": "Joanne Rowling  ( ROH-ling); born 31 July 1965), better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She wrote Harry Potter, a seven-volume fantasy series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 600 million copies, been translated into 84 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith.\nBorn in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.\nThe novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. There were also religious debates over the Harry Potter series.\nRowling has won many accolades for her work. She has received an OBE and was made a Companion of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. Harry Potter brought her wealth and recognition, which she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. She co-founded the charity Lumos and established the Volant Charitable Trust, named after her mother. Rowling's charitable giving centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children. In politics, she has donated to Britain's Labour Party and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit. She has publicly expressed her opinions on transgender people and related civil rights since 2017. These views have been described as transphobic by critics and LGBT rights organisations. They have divided feminists, fuelled debates on freedom of speech and cancel culture, and prompted declarations of support for transgender people from the literary, arts, and culture sectors.",

                "intro": "Deepak Chopra is a Canadian businessman who was, from January 18, 2011, until March 31, 2018, the president and chief executive officer of Canada Post Corporation. Chopra is a certified general accountant and a member of the Certified General Accountants of Ontario. In 2009, he was named a Fellow of the Certified General Accountants of Canada. He served from January 2011 to March 2018. Previously he was the President and chief executive officer of Pitney Bowes Canada and Latin America.Chopra was appointed to these roles by  the Conservative government of Stephen Harper on January 18, 2011, for a five-year term from February 1, 2011, to January 31, 2016. Chopra took over the post from Stewart Bacon, who returned from retirement as interim president and CEO in July 2010 when then-CEO Moya Greene left to take over Britain's national carrier, Royal Mail. This appointment was renewed by Harper's government in July 2015, just before the scheduled federal election in October 2015, for a five-year term starting February 2016 at an approximate salary of $500,000.In 2013, Canada Post, led by Chopra, introduced the extremely unpopular plan of eliminating door-to-door delivery of mail and converting to \"community mail boxes.\" This plan was opposed by all federal parties except the Conservatives during the Canadian Federal Election of 2015. The plan was stopped by the Liberal Party after they won the election.\nFollowing the 2015 federal election, Chopra was asked to resign and re-apply for his position by the newly elected government of Justin Trudeau. Chopra refused in a letter written by Sian Matthews, chair of the board of directors for Canada Post. In the summer of 2017, he announced that he would be stepping down on March 31, 2018, three years before his term was originally due to expire. He was succeeded, on an interim basis, by Jessica McDonald, former CEO of BC Hydro, effective April 2, 2018.",

Ringwald became a teen idol following her appearances in filmmaker John Hughes' teen films Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985), and Pretty in Pink (1986). These films led to the media referring to her as a member of the \"Brat Pack.\" Her final teen roles were in For Keeps and Fresh Horses (both in 1988). \nFollowing leading roles in King Lear (1987), The Pick-up Artist (1987), Strike It Rich (1990), and Betsy's Wedding (1990), Ringwald moved to Paris and began acting in French films. In subsequent decades, Ringwald acted in the television shows The Secret Life of the American Teenager (2008\u20132013), Riverdale (2017\u20132023), Creepshow (2021), and Dahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022).
