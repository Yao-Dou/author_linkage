                "intro": "The discography of Victoria Beckham, an English pop music singer, consists of one studio album, two cancelled albums, five singles, five music videos and one DVD. On 14 August 2000, Beckham released her first solo single, \"Out of Your Mind\" in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers, which debuted at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. Before the single's release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London's Hyde Park at a concert to raise money for the Prince's Trust charity. She sang \"Out of Your Mind\" to a 100,000-strong audience. Beckham then signed a recording contract with the Spice Girls' label Virgin Records. Her next single as a solo artist, \"Not Such an Innocent Girl\", was released on 17 September 2001. Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue's single \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\". Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6. Beckham's eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached number 10 in the UK Albums Chart. The album cost a reputed \u00a35 million to produce, and it sold a modest 100,000 copies. The second and final single to be released from the album was \"A Mind of Its Own\" on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK and sold 56,500 copies. A third single, \"I Wish\", was promoted but never materialised.\nIn 2002, Telstar Records signed Beckham in a deal made with 19 Management worth \u00a31.5 million. In 2003 Beckham's first single with Telstar, \"Let Your Head Go / This Groove\", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003 and charted at number 3. Beckham spent much of that year recording two pop/urban-influenced albums called Open Your Eyes and Come Together. These albums never materialised, and amidst the collapse of Telstar and bankruptcy of the label, remaining plans for Beckham's music career were shelved and cancelled. All promotional albums and tracks have been leaked and are available on YouTube and various sources online.",

He was a Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2005 to 2012, representing the remote electorate of Daly. He served as Minister for Local Government and Minister for Central Australia from 2008 to 2012. He also served as the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from 2006 to 2012, having been appointed to the position after the resignation of Len Kiely.\nPrior to entering politics, Knight was a park ranger. He contested the newly created seat of Daly in the 2001 election against Country Liberal Party (CLP) candidate Tim Baldwin (who had represented the now-abolished seat of Victoria River, which had been redistributed to form Daly), but was unsuccessful.He contested Daly again at the 2005 election after Baldwin retired, and was initially thought to have little chance of winning. Daly was a fairly safe CLP seat on paper; after a redistribution, the CLP held it on a notional majority of 9.5 percent. However, on election night the CLP primary vote almost halved, and Knight gained the seat with a swing of 24.6 percent, turning Daly from a safe CLP seat into a safe Labor seat at one stroke.  Knight actually won a majority on the first count, allowing him to take the seat from the CLP without the need for preferences. Even considering the size of the Labor wave that swept through the Territory, Knight's victory was considered a shock result, as a swing of this magnitude is almost unheard of at any level in Australia.Knight was reelected in 2008, but was defeated in 2012 by the CLP's Gary Higgins amid Labor's collapse in the remote portions of the Territory.\n\n",

He played college lacrosse at the University at Albany, and was selected seventh overall in the 2010 NLL Entry Draft by the Boston Blazers. Brock played two games with the blazers in 2011, before being released. He then signed with the Philadelphia Wings, with whom he spent two seasons, before being traded to the Bandits in 2012. Since then it has been hard to keep track of where David has played, he has packed his suitcase almost as much as Ryan Benesch. Brock was drafted in the fifth round (36th overall) of the 2010 MLL Collegiate Draft by the Toronto Nationals, but never played for the club. He has also played for the Kitchener-Waterloo Kodiaks of Major Series Lacrosse.",

She is a critic of Islam and advocate for the rights and self-determination of Muslim women, opposing forced marriage, honour killing, child marriage, and female genital mutilation.At the age of five, following local traditions in Somalia, Ali underwent female genital mutilation organized by her grandmother.  Her father\u2014a scholar, intellectual and a devout Muslim\u2014was against the procedure, but could not stop it from happening because he was imprisoned by the communist government of Somalia at the time. Her family moved across various countries in Africa and the Middle East, but at 23, she received political asylum in the Netherlands, gaining Dutch citizenship five years later. In her early 30s, Hirsi Ali renounced the Islamic faith of her childhood, began identifying as an atheist, and became involved in Dutch centre-right politics, joining the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).In 2003, Ali was elected to the lower house of the States General of the Netherlands. While serving in parliament, she collaborated on a short film with Theo van Gogh, titled Submission, which depicted the oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law, and was critical of the Muslim canon itself. The film led to death threats, and Van Gogh was murdered shortly after the film's release by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Moroccan-Dutch Islamic terrorist, driving Hirsi Ali into hiding.At this time she became more outspoken as a critic of the Muslim faith. In 2005, Time magazine named Ali as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Her outspoken criticism of Islam made her a controversial figure in Dutch politics and, following a political crisis related to the validity of her Dutch citizenship, she left the Parliament and, ultimately, the Netherlands.Moving to the United States, Ali established herself as a writer, activist and public intellectual. Her books Infidel: My Life (2007),\nNomad: From Islam to America (2010) and Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now (2015) became bestsellers. In Heretic, Ali seemed to be calling for reformation of Islam by countering Islamism and supporting reformist Muslims.In the United States, Ali has founded an organisation for the defense of women's rights, the AHA Foundation. She has taken roles at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, the American Enterprise Institute, and at Harvard Kennedy School as a senior fellow at the Future of Democracy Project. Since 2021, she has served as a columnist for UnHerd, a British online magazine and, since 2022, has hosted The Ayaan Hirsi Ali Podcast.Ali was a central figure in New Atheism since its beginnings. She was strongly associated with the movement, along with Christopher Hitchens, who regarded Ali as \"the most important public intellectual probably ever to come out of Africa.\"Writing in a column in November 2023, however, Ali announced her conversion to the Christian faith, claiming that in her view, the Judeo-Christian tradition is the only answer to the problems of the modern world. She has received several awards, including a free speech award from the centre-right Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, the Swedish conservative Liberal Party's Democracy Prize, and the Moral Courage Award for commitment to conflict resolution, ethics, and world citizenship. Critics have accused Ali of being Islamophobic or neo-orientalist and question her scholarly credentials \"to speak authoritatively about Islam and the Arab world\", saying she promotes the notion of a Western \"civilizing mission\". Ali is married to Scottish-American historian Niall Ferguson. The couple are raising their sons in the United States, where she became a citizen in 2013.",
