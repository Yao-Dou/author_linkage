For most people, birdsong is an agreeable soundtrack to a dog walk, a picnic, summer drinking, summer loving. It is the elevator music of the high spring: you are aware of it without being aware of it.\nBut then I learned the instruments of the orchestra, learned to tell one bird from another, learned to listen as well as to hear: and sudden",

                "intro": "Glenn Thomas Jacobs (born April 26, 1967), better known by his ring name Kane, is an American politician and professional wrestler. He has been signed to WWE since 1995 and was inducted into the 2021 class of the WWE Hall of Fame. In 2018, he was elected as the Republican Mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. In 2022, he won a second term as Mayor.\nJacobs began his professional wrestling career on the independent circuit in 1992, wrestling in promotions such as Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) and the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1995. Jacobs played various characters until 1997, when he was repackaged as the masked wrestler Kane, a horror-themed personification of fire and the juggernaut younger half-brother of The Undertaker and son of Paul Bearer. This \"hellfire and brimstone\" gimmick was rooted in acts of arson by The Undertaker as part of their characters' backstory. Jacobs would alternatively feud and team with The Undertaker, the latter as the Brothers of Destruction.\nFollowing his WWF debut, Kane remained a pivotal component of the company's \"Attitude Era\" of the late 1990s and early 2000s, defeating the era's \"poster boy\" Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship in his first pay-per-view (PPV) main event at King of the Ring in June 1998. He continued to headline PPV cards through 2018's Crown Jewel, and has appeared in more PPVs than any other performer in WWF/WWE history other than Randy Orton.Within WWE, Kane is a three-time world champion (having held the WWF Championship, ECW Championship and World Heavyweight Championship once each) and a 12-time world tag team champion (having held the World Tag Team Championship, WCW Tag Team Championship and WWE Tag Team Championships with various partners). He is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion and a Money in the Bank winner, as well as the third man to complete WWE's Grand Slam. The last title Kane won was the 24/7 Championship on September 16, 2019, the only title won under his real name.  Veteran wrestler Ric Flair described Kane as \"the best in the world\", while Big Show dubbed him \"the best big man ever\". Kane holds the record for the most appearances in a Royal Rumble match at 20, as well as the highest cumulative total eliminations at 46.Outside of professional wrestling, Jacobs has made numerous guest appearances in film and on television, including the lead role in the 2006 WWE Studios production See No Evil and its 2014 sequel. He is also a longtime supporter of libertarian political causes. In March 2017, Jacobs announced that he was running for the mayoral seat of Knox County, Tennessee as a Republican. He won the Republican primary election on May 1, 2018, and the general election on August 2, 2018. He was re-elected as Knox County Mayor on August 4, 2022.",

                "description": "American audio podcast and former radio program",
                "intro": "The Writer's Almanac is a daily podcast and newsletter of poetry and historical interest pieces, usually of literary significance. Begun as a radio program in 1993, it is hosted by Garrison Keillor and was produced and distributed by American Public Media through November 2017. It is also available as a podcast. Past program sponsors include The Poetry Foundation (using funds from a large bequest from philanthropist Ruth Lilly), publisher of Poetry Magazine and The Mosaic Foundation of Rita and Peter Heydon.\nEach program is at least five minutes long and begins with the phrase \"And here is the Writer's Almanac for [insert date here]\". Each program includes vignettes about authors and other noteworthy people whose birthdays or significant events coincide with the program's date, as well as excerpts of important events in history. The program continues with one or more poems chosen by Keillor, and ends with Keillor's traditional sign-off, \"Be well, do good work, and keep in touch.\" The program's theme music is a version of the Swedish song \"Ge mig en dag\", performed by Richard Dworsky on the piano. The original theme music was from Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Slavonic Dance, Op. 72, No. 8.Written by Betsy Allister, Joy Biles, Priscilla Kinter, Heather McPherson, and Holly Vanderhaar, the program was engineered and edited by Thomas Scheuzger, Noah Smith, and Sam Hudson. Production assistance was by Kathy Roach and Katrina Cicala.\nIn 2005 the program was briefly canceled by Kentucky public radio station WUKY due to concerns about purportedly indecent content in some of the poems. The station reinstated the program after receiving an \"outpouring of support\" for it. The program was distributed in APM's Classical 24 stream and many stations that carry it air all or mostly Classical music during other times.\nIn November 2017, after allegations of inappropriate behavior by Keillor toward someone who worked for him on a freelance basis, Minnesota Public Radio terminated its contracts with him and his private media companies. This effectively ended the distribution and broadcast of The Writer's Almanac on public radio, as well as rebroadcasts of Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion.In the spring 2018, Keillor restarted The Writer's Almanac on his website. In summer 2018, he added the option of subscribing to the newsletter version.\n\nIn April 2018, Minnesota Public Radio posted a message stating its intent to re-establish the online archives of The Writer's Almanac and A Prairie Home Companion: Minnesota Public Radio has reached an agreement with Garrison Keillor to restore free public access to the online archives of A Prairie Home Companion and The Writer's Almanac. They say that past performances of these popular shows will be returned to their respective websites: Prairiehome.org and Writersalmanac.org]. MPR paid Keillor $275,000 as a final settlement.\n\"These archives feature the work of thousands of talented artists, poets, and musicians,\" said Jon McTaggart, president and CEO of Minnesota Public Radio and American Public Media Group. \"We are pleased that these performances will once again be available to fans of these programs.\".",

                "intro": "Charles Hurt Murphy III (December 6, 1947 \u2013 January 8, 2018) was an American bishop. He was the missionary bishop, bishop ordinary and chairman of the Anglican Mission in the Americas, the former missionary wing of the Anglican Church of Rwanda in the United States and Canada, since its origin in 2000. He was married for more than 40 years and had three adult daughters. He came from a family of Episcopal priests, being the son, brother and brother-in-law of priests.\nMurphy was born in Decatur, Alabama. Murphy graduated from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He afterwards moved to Trinity College in Bristol, England, where he studied theology under J. I. Packer. He completed his theology training at the University of the South. He died at Litchfield Plantation, Pawleys Island, South Carolina.He served in several congregations in the United States, until being called to serve as rector of All Saints' Church in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, in 1982, where he would stay for more than 20 years.\nA traditionalist Episcopalian, he opposed the more liberal tendencies of Anglicanism in North America. He convened and chaired the First Promise Movement in 1997, which issued the document \"The First Promise\" which \"declared the authority of the Episcopal Church to be 'fundamentally impaired' because they no longer upheld the 'truth of the gospel'\". The First Promise Movement is the origin of the formation of the AMiA in 2000, as the mission of the Anglican Church of Rwanda in the United States and Canada. The AMiA was a founding member of the Common Cause Partnership in June 2004, among six traditionalist Anglican organizations. It was a founding member of the Anglican Church in North America in June 2009, changing his status to \"ministry partner\" in June 2010. In December 2011, the AMiA split from the ACNA and lost its status with the Anglican Church of Rwanda. After temporary affiliation with the Anglican Church of Congo, the AMiA was revamped as a \"Society of Missionary and Apostolic Works\" in 2012.\nMurphy retired in December 2013 and was replaced by Bishop Philip Jones. He died on January 8, 2018, of brain cancer.",

The videos for the Spanish versions of the four singles were subsequently released in conjunction with the promotion of Aguilera's 2000 Spanish album Mi Reflejo. In 2001, Aguilera appeared in the music video for \"Lady Marmalade\", a collaboration with M\u00fda, Lil' Kim, and Pink, which earned two MTV Video Music Awards for Video of the Year and Best Video from a Film at the 2001 ceremony.Aguilera generated much attention in mid-2002 following the release of the music video for \"Dirrty\"\u2013her fourth studio album Stripped's lead single, which was found controversial owing to the depiction of overtly sexual activities. However, she later received praise in late 2002 for the visual for Stripped's second single \"Beautiful\", which received a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayal of gay people and \"message about self-respect and empowerment.\" In 2004, Aguilera made an appearance on Nelly's video \"Tilt Ya Head Back\", which was noted for her imitation of Marilyn Monroe. In 2006, Aguilera released her fifth studio album Back to Basics; three music videos for the singles \"Ain't No Other Man\", \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\" from the album were shot. The lead single's video was directed by Bryan Barber and was highlighted for portraying Aguilera's then newly established alter ego Baby Jane. Aguilera's 2010 studio album Bionic was promoted by the video releases of \"Not Myself Tonight\" and \"You Lost Me\", and her 2012 studio album Lotus received its promotion from the video for \"Your Body\".\nIn addition to her music videos, Aguilera has released five video albums. Four DVDs Genie Gets Her Wish, My Reflection, Stripped Live in the U.K., and Back to Basics: Live and Down Under were filmed in accompaniment with Aguilera's concert tours Christina Aguilera in Concert (2000), The Stripped Tour (2003), and Back to Basics Tour (2006\u20132008). Meanwhile, the other video album Back to Basics and Beyond was released exclusively in North America in 2006 in conjunction with the promotion of the album Back to Basics. Aguilera's first film appearance was in Shark Tale (2004), in which she voiced a Rastafarian jellyfish and for whose soundtrack she recorded a song titled \"Car Wash\" with Missy Elliott. She subsequently starred in the 2010 film Burlesque as Ali Rose, a dancer in a burlesque club. The film received lukewarm critical reception and garnered over US$90.5 million. She has additionally appeared in several television shows, including the reality television series The Voice, of which six out of ten seasons saw her contribution as a coach and judge.\n\n",
