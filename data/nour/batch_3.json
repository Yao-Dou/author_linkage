While employed by the RAND Corporation, he precipitated a national political controversy in 1971 when he released the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret Pentagon study of U.S. government decision-making in relation to the Vietnam War, to The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other newspapers.\nIn January 1973, Ellsberg was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 along with other charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a maximum sentence of 115 years. Because of governmental misconduct and illegal evidence-gathering (committed by the same people who would later be involved in the Watergate scandal), and his defense by Leonard Boudin and Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson, Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. dismissed all charges against Ellsberg in May 1973.\nEllsberg was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 2006. He was also known for having formulated an important example in decision theory, the Ellsberg paradox; for his extensive studies on nuclear weapons and nuclear policy; and for voicing support for WikiLeaks, Chelsea Manning, and Edward Snowden. Ellsberg was awarded the 2018 Olof Palme Prize for his \"profound humanism and exceptional moral courage\".",

                "intro": "Jared Corey Kushner (born January 10, 1981) is an American businessman, investor, and former government official. He is the son-in-law of former president Donald Trump through his marriage to Ivanka Trump, and served as a senior advisor to Trump from 2017 to 2021. He was also Director of the Office of American Innovation.\nFor much of his career, Kushner worked as a real-estate investor in New York City, especially through the family business Kushner Companies. He took over the company after his father Charles Kushner was convicted for 18 criminal charges, including illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering in 2005, although Charles was controversially pardoned by Trump in 2020. Jared met Ivanka Trump around 2005, and the couple married in 2009. He also became involved in the newspaper industry after purchasing The New York Observer in 2006. He was registered as a Democrat and donated to Democratic politicians for much of his life, but registered as Independent in 2009 and eventually as Republican in 2018. He played a significant role in the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign, and was at one point seen as its de facto campaign manager. Around Trump's election, Kushner was frequently accused of conflicts of interest, profiting from policy proposals for which he personally advocated within the Trump administration.\nHe became Senior Advisor to President Trump in 2017, and held the position until Trump left office in 2021. His appointment was followed by concerns of nepotism.  Here, he led the administration's effort to pass the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill signed into law in 2018. Kushner was the primary Trump administration participant for the Middle East Peace Process, authoring the Trump peace plan and facilitating the talks that led to the signing of the Abraham Accords and other normalization agreements between Israel and various Arab states in 2020. Kushner also played an influential role in the Trump administration's COVID-19 response. Despite initially advising Trump that the media was exaggerating the threat of the disease, he eventually became a leader in the federal effort to procure medical supplies and develop a vaccine as a founding board member on Operation Warp Speed. He was a leading broker in the US\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada agreement, for which he was awarded honors by the Mexican government.\nSince leaving the White House, Kushner founded Affinity Partners, a private equity firm that derives most of its funds from Saudi government's sovereign wealth fund.",

                "intro": "David Henry French (30 May 1933 \u2013 19 March 2017) was a British archaeologist known especially for his work in Asia Minor.French was born on 30 May 1933 in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Having received a free place as a direct grant pupil, he was educated at Pocklington School, a private school in Pocklington. He studied classics at St Catharine's College, Cambridge.French was married to Elizabeth \"Lisa\" French (n\u00e9e Wace), a noted Mycenae archaeologist, between the years 1959 and 1975. Together they had two daughters.He was one of the leading archaeologists of his generation and the 4th director of the British Institute at Ankara (BIAA) (1968-1994). After he was appointed to this position, he continued his previous work on Can Hasan, who provided an important overview of the Chalcolithic Period in the region and determined the transitional sequences from the Neolithic period. Among the many projects, salvage excavations at A\u015fvan Castle and Tille H\u00f6y\u00fck stand out. In the field of epigraphy, David French initiated a major project: the investigation of Asia Minor milestones, resulting in an unprecedented mapping of the ancient routes in Anatolia and became an important reference work. Although the project took many years of fieldwork, David French managed to record milestones and related inscriptions in all the Roman provinces of Anatolia west of the Euphrates. French published his first monograph on this project in 1981 and a two-volume preliminary catalogue in 1988. His final publications, Roman Roads and Milestones of Asia Minor 3: Milestones and Roman Roads and Milestones of Asia Minor 4: Road published by BIAA as e-monographs. \nHe made significant contributions to the institute's scientific output until his death. To honor him and his hardworks for the Institute his name is given to Institute's library: The David H. French Library. After his death the book David French: A Life in Anatolian Archaeology was published in 2020.",

A 24-year-old suspect, Hadi Matar, was arrested directly and charged the following day with assault and attempted murder. Rushdie was gravely wounded and hospitalized. Interviewer Henry Reese was also injured by the attacker.\nRushdie, an Indian-born British-American, has been threatened with death since 1989, a year after the publication of his novel The Satanic Verses, when the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for his assassination and set a bounty of $3 million for his death. For years, Rushdie had lived in hiding, taking strict security measures that gradually became more relaxed over time.\nThe government of Iran denied having foreknowledge of the stabbing, although state-controlled agencies of the Iranian media celebrated it. U.S. law enforcement is investigating whether the assailant was in contact with other extremists. Rushdie\u2019s memoir about the attack, Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder, is scheduled for publication in April 2024.",

He was an investigative reporter, columnist and news editor at the Philadelphia City Paper for many years, and its editor-in-chief from March 2003 until he was fired in May 2004.  During his tenure at the City Paper, Altman won multiple local and state awards in the \"weekly alternative\" or \"non-daily\" categories for his columns, sports coverage, and investigative reporting.  Altman and colleagues have also won awards as editors for the front-page design of the City Paper's issue dealing with the September 11, 2001 attacks.\nRelocating to Tampa, Florida, Altman joined The Tampa Tribune as courts and cops editor in the converged newsroom of the Tribune, Tampa Bay Online (tbo.com) and the local NBC television affiliate, WFLA-TV. There, he helped form the Continuous News Desk, which merged all three platforms into one synchronized unit he helped run. It revolutionized how and when news was delivered across platforms. Page views and time on site skyrocketed, forcing competition to follow suit. \nAltman later became the Tribune's military reporter, given the large military presence in the Tampa Bay.  This presence includes MacDill Air Force Base, the two unified combatant commands that are headquartered at MacDill AFB, the Avon Park Air Force Range, Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg, numerous smaller U.S. Coast Guard installations, multiple homeported Coast Guard cutters, various Reserve and National Guard facilities, two large Veterans Administration medical centers, and one of the largest active duty military, reserve military (to include National Guard), retired military and non-career military veteran populations in Florida.\nWith the May 2016 acquisition of The Tampa Tribune by its long-time St. Petersburg, Florida-based competitor, The Tampa Bay Times (formerly The St. Petersburg Times), Altman became the senior writer/military affairs for The Tampa Bay Times.  In addition to print media, Altman is also a periodic guest on local radio and television segments in the Tampa Bay area regarding military affairs. After departing Tampa Bay, Altman moved to  MilitaryTimes as senior managing editor. In February 2022 he was fired by MilitaryTimes. In April 2022 The War Zone announced his hire as a staff writer.",

Levant is the founder and former publisher of the conservative magazine, The Western Standard. He is also the co-founder, owner, and CEO of the far-right media website Rebel News. Levant has also worked as a columnist for Sun Media, and he hosted a daily program on the Sun News Network from the channel's inception in 2011 until its demise in 2015.\nLevant rose to prominence in 2006 after publishing the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons in The Western Standard, which led to a protracted legal battle with the Alberta Human Rights Commission regarding hate speech legislation and freedom of speech. The complaint against Levant was ultimately withdrawn. In February 2015, Levant co-founded Rebel News with Brian Lilley; Lilley left Rebel News in 2017 citing lack of editorial standards. Under Levant, Rebel News has been described as a platform for the anti-Islamic ideology known as counter-jihad.Levant self-identifies as a libertarian conservative; however, he has also been identified as belonging to the Canadian far right. He is a prominent supporter of the Canadian petroleum industry and fracking. Levant has been successfully sued for libel on multiple occasions, while apologies and retractions were issued by him or on his behalf on numerous other occasions.",

He has covered each presidential campaign since 2012, as well as numerous U.S. Senate, congressional and gubernatorial races. Much of his reporting has focused on voters, demographics and the battleground states; especially as Donald  Trump disrupted traditional party coalitions.  In 2015, Gabriel was based in Iowa during the run-up to the presidential caucuses, as Trump began consolidating his hold on Republicans.In 2019, his article about Representative Steve King of Iowa as a precursor to Trump's politics of anti-immigrant nationalism created an uproar, after King told the reporter: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d King, a Republican, was stripped of his committee assignments in the House of Representatives by republican leaders.Other coverage by Gabriel that had a high impact included reporting about Republicans using critical race theory as a culture-war issue in 2021; the political formation of Pete Buttigieg when he sought the 2020 Democratic nomination; the crushing down-ballot losses by Democrats in 2020, and the foreign policy stumbles of Ben Carson in 2015, in which an advisor to Carson, Duane R.
